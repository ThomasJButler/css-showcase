## üíª Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use UK English
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Example:
```
Add pure CSS tooltip component

- Create tooltip.html demo page
- Add hover and focus states
- Include accessibility attributes
- Support multiple positions (top, bottom, left, right)
```

### HTML Style Guide

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain consistent 2-space indentation
- Use descriptive class names with kebab-case
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Add comments for complex structures

Example:
```html
<section class="demo-section" aria-labelledby="section-title">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 id="section-title" class="section-title">Demo Title</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Introduction text here...
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

### CSS Style Guide

- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Group related properties together
- Use meaningful class names (BEM-inspired)
- Add comments for complex selectors or calculations
- Use UK English in comments (colour not color)

Example:
```css
/* Button component with hover state */
.btn-primary {
  /* Positioning */
  display: inline-block;
  
  /* Box model */
  padding: var(--space-3) var(--space-6);
  margin: 0;
  
  /* Typography */
  font-weight: var(--font-medium);
  text-decoration: none;
  
  /* Visual */
  background: var(--colour-primary);
  color: white;
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
  
  /* Behaviour */
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all var(--transition-base);
}

.btn-primary:hover {
  background: var(--colour-primary-dark);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Keep it minimal - this is a CSS showcase!

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Copies code snippet to clipboard
 * @param {string} code - The code to copy
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
const copyToClipboard = async (code) => {
  try {
    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(code);
    showNotification('Copied to clipboard!');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to copy:', err);
    showNotification('Failed to copy code');
  }
};
```

## üé® Design Principles

1. **Pure CSS First** - Prioritise CSS solutions over JavaScript
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Ensure basic functionality works everywhere
3. **Accessibility** - Make it usable for everyone
4. **Performance** - Keep it fast and lightweight
5. **Educational** - Code should be clear and learnable

## üìù Adding a New Demo Page

When adding a new CSS demo page:

1. Create the HTML file following the existing structure
2. Create a corresponding CSS file in `styles/`
3. Add navigation links to all existing pages
4. Include proper meta tags and descriptions
5. Add browser support information where relevant
6. Update the README.md if it's a significant addition

## üêõ Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari minimum)
2. Check responsive behaviour on mobile and desktop
3. Verify dark/light mode works correctly
4. Test keyboard navigation
5. Run through with a screen reader if possible
